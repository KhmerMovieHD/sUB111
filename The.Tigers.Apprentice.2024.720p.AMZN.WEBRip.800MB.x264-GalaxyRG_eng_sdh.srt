in high school.

164
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:24,934
Ah Ma, chill.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,869
She's just a friend, okay?

166
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,705
She probably got scared off
anyway by our crazy house.

167
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:31,407
Crazy amazing?

168
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:34,276
[sighs] At least
she didn't see the inside.

169
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:38,280
Tom, even if these charms
seem silly to you,

170
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,349
they are important to me.

171
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,551
I still don't even know
what they mean.

172
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,687
You don't have to know
to understand.

173
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,388
Ah Ma, you're talking
to me in riddles.

174
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:47,790
One day,

175
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:51,427
you will see yourself
for what you truly are

176
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,462
and not what you appear to be.

177
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,364
And what does that mean?

178
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:56,799
[exclaims]

179
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,802
We talked about this.

180
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,706
Ah Tom, we don't use these.

181
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:06,709
We use this and this.

182
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,911
We don't have to fight.

183
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:11,747
Besides, you're not
too good at it.

184
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,482
The kid called you a witch.

185
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,617
So? Maybe I am a witch.

186
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:17,753
Ha-ha. Very funny.

187
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,390
This bully at school,
he needs your compassion.

188
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,891
What? Why?

189
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,628
Because he himself
was probably hurt
at some point.

190
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,565
People are
inherently good, Tom.

191
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,800
Our family has always
believed this.

192
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,136
What family?
It's just you and me.

193
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:37,740
Your lineage goes back
a thousand generations.

194
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,708
Our traditions
live on in you.

195
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:43,779
Yeah, well, maybe we could try
being a little less traditional
for once.

196
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,348
Obviously,
I'm proud of it
or whatever.

197
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,449
"Or whatever"?

198
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,084
[sighs]

199
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,721
I just wanna be normal.

200
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:56,392
[chuckles]
Ah Tom, you are not normal.

201
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,560
Great. Thanks.

202
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:04,066
Our entire family
is very not normal.

203
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:08,437
I've been waiting to talk to you
about this for a long time.

204
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:12,441
But first, you must
put the charms back up.

205
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,776
And then, we'll talk.

206
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:15,711
[sighs] Okay, Grandma.

207
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,248
[Mrs. Lee speaks in Mandarin]
Hurry up!

208
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:27,856
[person] You can't just
put them up like that.
[gasps]

209
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,260
Whoa, dude!

210
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,961
There's a system.

211
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:35,364
Who are you?

212
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,633
How long were
the protective charms down?

213
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,568
Like, for five minutes, okay?

214
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,336
Do I know you, man?
No.

215
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,538
But I know you.

216
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,406
Whoa! Ew! Are you sniffing me?

217
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:45,974
Yeah. And you reek, kid.

218
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,876
[sniffs] No, I don't.

219
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,412
Where's your grandmother?
Mrs. Lee, are you okay?

220
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,181
Dude. Okay.

221
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,316
Keep your shoes on.
That's not rude at all.

222
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,386
There we go.
So you have tracking mud
and all that stuff, okay.

223
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,555
[gasps] Hu!
Mei Ling.

224
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,491
It's so good to see you.

225
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,594
No pinching necessary,
all right?
We spoke about this.

226
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:08,797
Tom, this is Hu,
my old friend.

227
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,165
An old friend?

228
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,967
Like, what kind of friend
are we talking here?

229
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,603
Platonic, hopefully.

230
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,305
Ugh, there's no time
for this.

231
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,108
I picked up the scent of <i>fashu</i>
at the boy's school today.

232
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,008
Magic?

233
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,844
I know. I felt it too.

234
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,779
He stinks of it.
You could be in danger.

235
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,013
Calm down.

236
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,982
We were just about
to have "the talk."

237
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:30,752
Ew. Ah Ma, no,
I don't need the talk.
I'm 15.

238
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,723
So the charms are down,
the kid still doesn't know
who he is,

239
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,393
and none of the Zodiacs
have been following
any of my protocols.

240
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,764
Tom, your fight today.
What exactly happened?

241
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:45,300
I mean, this kid,
he got all mad at me.

242
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:49,037
Huge guy, you know?
Shoulders all puffed out.
Kinda like you actually.

243
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,839
[mock chuckles]
Cut to the chase.

244
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,942
It wasn't me.
This kid, he started it.

245
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,044
Did you finish it?
What?

246
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,846
Did anything strange happen?

247
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,515
Yeah-- No, not really.

248
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:03,452
Other than
when I threw him
into the ceiling.

249
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,020
Oh, boy.

250
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,488
Wait. Nobody saw you, right?

251
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:10,626
No, no, not really.
Just about a hundred kids or so.

252
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,594
Oh, we gotta
get out of here.

253
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,696
Grandma, who is this guy?

254
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:16,899
[chuckles] "This guy"?

255
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,867
I'm a Warrior
of the Circle of Twelve,

256
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:21,103
sworn to protect
the Guardian of the Phoenix.

257
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,906
Ah Ma, like
from the kids' stories?

258
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,274
I'm a Zodiac.

259
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,110
Okay. Hi.
I'm Tom, House of Lee.

260
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,747
Lactose-intolerant and guardian
of a Steph Curry rookie card.

261
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:32,814
"Kids' stories"?

262
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,683
I wanted to give him time.

263
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,451
Time for what?

264
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:39,888
Seriously? Guys! Hello!
I'm right here.

265
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,557
We know, kid.
We know you're here.

266
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:42,891
Dude, what is your problem?

267
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,127
Everybody knows you're here!

268
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,296
Does anything you say
make sense?

269
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:49,898
[muffled]
Everything I say makes sense.

270
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,434
Something's here.
[rumbling]

271
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:55,070
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, earthquake!
Nope.

272
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,738
Put on your shoes, Tom.

273
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,607
[gasps]
How did you do that?

274
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,612
Whoa.

275
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,048
Ah!

276
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,150
Ah Ma.
Oh, yeah!

277
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,985
I'll cover the front,
you get the back.

278
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:12,087
No. This is powerful <i>fashu.</i>

279
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,889
You and Tom need to go.

280
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,224
What? No!

281
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,593
Get him to safety.
He needs you, Hu.

282
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:21,330
Tom. Tom, look at me.

283
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,198
I promise
I'll explain everything,

284
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:25,634
but right now
you have to go with Hu.

285
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,102
I'm not leaving you.

286
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:31,673
Loo.
Go! Now!

287
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,075
No, wait--
Go!

288
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:35,978
Whoa!

289
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,413
[Loo] Mrs. Lee.

290
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:41,950
Loo.

291
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:44,753
We can make this easy.

292
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,022
You know what I want, old woman.

293
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,424
Then come and get it.

294
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,660
Go!

295
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,228
Bring me the Phoenix.

296
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,564
[growling]

297
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:05,073
How precious.
[chuckles]

298
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,113
[Tom] Grandma!

299
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:15,117
Whoa. Whoa.

300
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh, whoa! No, no, no, no, no!

301
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:20,522
Back off!

302
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,163
Huh?

303
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,702
Oh, I really missed doing that.

304
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,871
What happened to your pants?

305
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:38,140
Oh, great. More <i>yaoguai.</i>

306
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,642
What the heck is a <i>yao--</i>
[exclaims]

307
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,450
No Zodiac Warriors
to protect you now.

308
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,218
Just you and me.

309
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:55,123
Unless you prefer I start
with your darling grandson.

310
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,059
Stay away from him!

311
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,530
[grunting]

312
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,875
Come on! Come on!
Giddyap, tiger! [screams]

313
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,211
Say that again,
and I will eat you.

314
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,548
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on! [screams]

315
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:26,088
[roars]

316
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,057
No, no, no! Oh, my gosh!

317
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:31,226
No, no, no! Get off my--

318
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,363
Ow! Watch what you're kicking.

319
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,164
Oh!

320
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,369
[screams]

321
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:42,938
Tiger! Tiger, help!

322
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,639
[screams]

323
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:47,542
[grunts]

324
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,082
[chuckles]

325
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,418
[grunts]
[cackles]

326
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:59,755
Look at you, so fragile now.

327
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,990
So old.

328
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:04,126
Do you need a hand?

329
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,661
[shouts]

330
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:09,631
I'll give you two!

331
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,681
[groans]
Right on a used diaper.
[Tom] Ah Ma!

332
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,788
Ah Ma!

333
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,657
Ah Tom, are you okay?

334
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,360
[grunting]

335
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,696
You think
I'm so easily defeated?

336
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:43,298
I'll take that.

337
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,100
No! Let her go!

338
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,204
Not while I'm Guardian!

339
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,595
Ah Ma.

340
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:20,869
[Tom] What?

341
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,771
What is that?

342
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:24,873
[Hu] The Ghost Cart.

343
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,176
Comes to carry away the souls
of the great and the noble.

344
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,322
Ah Ma!

345
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:08,149
Come on, kid. Keep up.

346
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:19,861
Quick, inside.

347
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,607
I have to alert the others.

348
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,611
What good is that gonna do?
No. No, we need to...

349
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:39,281
Why are we in a junk shop?
Antique shop.

350
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:40,815
Not junk.

351
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,117
I live here.

352
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,952
I've been here
watching over you.

353
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,520
You and those monsters--

354
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:49,758
<i>Yaoguai.</i> Loo's creatures.
Vicious little creatures.

355
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:53,194
They were just crazy stories
my grandma told me
when I was little.

356
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,363
Well, they're not stories, okay?

357
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,666
Not stories, kid.

358
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:58,667
[grunts]

359
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,902
Your grandmother
was a Guardian, Tom.

360
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,203
One of the best.

361
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,773
She gave her life
to protect that.

362
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,374
Her necklace?

363
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,076
It's the Phoenix.

364
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:11,680
Ever since goddess Nu Kua
used the Phoenix
to create humanity,

365
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:14,082
dark forces have been trying
to capture it.

366
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:17,586
Whoa.
Now the duty of
protecting it is yours.

367
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,121
What? That's not...

368
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,625
I have to go home.
I have school tomorrow.

369
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,094
And Grandma, she's...

370
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,495
You can't leave, kid.

371
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,331
It's my job.

372
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,202
I don't even know you, man.

373
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:38,607
If you're a Zodiac Warrior,
I thought your job was
to protect Ah Ma!

374
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:42,077
Tom--
You left her there!
You could've saved her.

375
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,311
Hey.

376
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:45,513
I gotta get out of here.
Stop. No, no.

377
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,215
You can't go-- Wait.
Get off of me!

378
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,150
No, no, no.
You need to know about...

379
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:50,418
[grunts]

380
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,087
[panting]

381
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,189
...the exit spell
on the door.

382
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,457
[sighs]

383
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,592
Mrs. Lee put you in my care.

384
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:00,462
That makes you my apprentice.

385
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:03,565
There's a room upstairs.
Why don't you take it?

386
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,533
Fine.

387
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:08,503
Dumb tiger.

388
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,540
[sighs]

389
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,843
[siren wailing in distance]

390
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,683
This can't be happening.

391
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:26,054
Just a junky necklace.

392
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:30,959
[sighs]

393
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:33,328
Whoa!

394
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:34,763
Come on!

395
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,720
[screams]

396
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:05,326
Who dares wake
the Empress Nu Kua?

397
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,496
Um, Tom?

398
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,666
Oh, it's you.

399
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:14,736
You walk two worlds now--

400
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:18,540
the mortal world
and the world of magic.

401
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,677
[screams, panting]

402
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:25,914
Okay.

403
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,817
I really am losing it.

404
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,828
I thought
she was gonna be okay.

405
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,401
I'm sorry, kid.

406
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,072
[sniffles]

407
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,081
[clears throat]

408
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,316
I don't know what they put
in incense these days,

409
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,586
but it really
irritates my eyes.

410
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:41,422
Yeah.

411
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,425
Yeah, me too.

412
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:00,675
[snoring]

413
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:07,182
[sighs]

414
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:11,853
Psst. Hey. Tom?

415
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,489
Tom. Kid!

416
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,130
Wake up already!

417
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:24,032
Ow. Cut your nails.

418
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:28,503
[roars]

419
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,772
[panting]

420
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,675
What the heck?
Is that how you wake people up?

421
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:36,077
Well, next time
I'll sing you a song.

422
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:38,413
Now, come on.
Time to get to work.

423
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:41,716
Work? I don't know what
you're thinking with all
this apprentice stuff,

424
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:45,086
but I'm not waxing cars
for you, man. Whoa.

425
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,223
I know it's cool. Come on.

426
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:51,459
I need to see
what I'm working with.

427
00:23:51,526 --> 00:23:53,828
Try to hit me.
What? For real?

428
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:57,532
Unless you don't think
you're up for it. [roars]

429
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,602
[grunts]
Oh, it's on, fur face!

430
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,573
You'll have to do
better than that.

431
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,710
You think a <i>yaoguai</i>
is just gonna stand there
and wait for you?

432
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,689
So, I can't hit you.

433
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,858
Is that the big point
you're trying to make?

434
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:27,562
No. The point is,
you're missing the point.

435
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,632
Exactly how many times
did you try to strike me
just now?

436
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:32,200
I don't know.

437
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,334
Eight.

438
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:34,769
And how many times
did you check

439
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:37,038
to make sure that
the Phoenix was still with you?

440
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,774
Not once.

441
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,976
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

442
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:45,146
Rat!
[squeaking]

443
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:46,147
[gasps]

444
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,049
I told you to stay
out of my wallet!

445
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:49,384
Get over here!

446
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,220
No, no, no, no,
that thing's ex--

447
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:54,622
[crashing]
You're gonna pay for that!

448
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,691
That's what you get!

449
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:57,992
How many years of--
[exclaims]

450
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:01,629
Stop stealing my stuff!

451
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,564
Hi there!

452
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:08,403
Oh, my gosh!
Did you see that? I did it!

453
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:11,039
The thing!
I did the thing,
the bow, bow, bow!

454
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:14,475
Don't get cocky.
That was a defensive <i>fashu.</i>

455
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,177
It's reflex.

456
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,946
Tom, this is Rat.

457
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:20,381
Wait. He's a Zodiac.

458
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:21,549
He's like you.

459
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:23,685
Are you trying to insult me?

460
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,688
Sidney's my name.
Acquisitions is my game.

461
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:29,057
[laughing]

462
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:30,625
Acquisitions?

463
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:32,160
You're a thief.
Thief?

464
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,162
You stole
my Ming dynasty sword.

465
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:37,332
Make sure he didn't
steal your watch.
I don't have a watch.

466
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:40,935
No problem.
I got a bunch. Want one?
I'll give you friend prices.

467
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,503
[Hu] Sidney,
what are you doing here?

468
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,805
Oh.

469
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,107
And we're going
with rat again. Okay.

470
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,577
Hu, that's what
I came to tell you.
I saw Loo last night.

471
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:50,611
What?

472
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,280
Sid, that's not possible.

473
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:53,748
We saw her die.

474
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:56,651
I was out wandering around
the old high-rent district

475
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:57,952
by the sea cliffs.

476
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,254
<i>They got
the most exquisite trash.</i>

477
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:03,891
<i>I found a primo clam chowder
in the gutter.</i>

478
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,128
<i>And then, out of nowhere,
there's Loo!</i>

479
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:09,831
<i>It was at this
abandoned mansion,
and I thought,</i>

480
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:13,267
<i>"Now, is she here
for the clam chowder too?"</i>

481
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:16,137
<i>She looked disgusting.</i>

482
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,006
<i>And I don't just throw
that word around.</i>

483
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:20,274
<i>She crawled
into this creepy fountain,</i>

484
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:24,812
<i>and the water, Hu,
it healed her!</i>

485
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,281
<i>Obviously,
I came straight here.</i>

486
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:33,254
I know that place.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go get her.

487
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,856
What? No!
Why not?

488
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:36,691
Because you're gonna
get yourself killed.

489
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,793
Loo isn't
just another <i>yaoguai.</i>

490
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,862
She's as powerful
as a Guardian.

491
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:42,630
She can access
the darkest magic.

492
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:45,233
We should go to the temple
and get the rest of the Zodiacs.

493
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,669
Exactly! Let's do that.
Team Zodiac assemble!

494
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,104
I work better alone.

495
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:52,340
Come on, Hu.
You know it'll
be safer for him

496
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:54,008
with all of us together.

497
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,545
[sighs]
[yelps]

498
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,580
Fine.
We'll go get the Zodiacs.

499
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:00,815
Yes!

500
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,450
I already regret this.

501
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:06,087
[sighs]
You gotta be kidding me.
Hey.

502
00:27:06,154 --> 00:27:08,356
Got a little
new Guardian gift for ya.

503
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:10,124
Whoops! That's not it!

504
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:13,194
Found that on the bus,
so you know it's good.

505
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:15,263
You might need this.

506
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,866
Now, remember,
you didn't get this from me.

507
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,338
Whoa.

508
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:26,374
Is that Ming dynasty?

509
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:28,476
Sweet!

510
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:33,614
Chinatown is the most
delicious place in the world!

511
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,783
[sniffs] Excuse me.

512
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:40,455
Oh. Mmm.

513
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,789
Do you smell that?

514
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,791
Rotting fish,
splattered soy sauce.

515
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:45,726
[patron screams]
[waiter shouts]

516
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,929
[yelps] Rude!

517
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:51,032
Is that moldy ginseng?

518
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,868
Dumplings!
Can you believe someone
threw these out?

519
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:54,936
Come on, Rat.

520
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:58,005
[Sidney] Yes! [chuckles]

521
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:01,976
There it is.
Wait, we're getting dim sum?

522
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:04,512
[Hu] Not everything
is what it seems, kid.

523
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:07,815
[Sidney shrieks]

524
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:08,983
It's only one of them.

525
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,318
I'm pretty sure
I can handle--

526
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:15,323
Crap.
Not everything is
what it seems, right?

527
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:17,925
[Hu] Oh, yeah.

528
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:20,161
Mess with the Tiger,
you get the claws.

529
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:22,296
What? That's not a thing.
Yes, it is.

530
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:25,099
No, it isn't.
No one says that.
Tigers do.

531
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,406
Whoa.

532
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:33,941
Oh, you!

533
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,313
[chuckles] What?

534
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,817
Ah. Come on. Let's do this!

535
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:45,253
Show-off.

536
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,388
[roars]

537
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:49,924
Yeah, yeah, you can fly.

538
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,937
Yo! That was incredible!

539
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,438
Gentlemen.

540
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:05,673
Mistral.

541
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,675
I was doing just fine
without you.

542
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,043
Yes, I saw.

543
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,745
It's good to see you, rodent.

544
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,680
[giggles]
She called me "rodent."

545
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:14,248
[Mistral] Thomas Lee.

546
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:17,585
It will be my honor
to protect you and guide you.

547
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:20,454
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Mrs. Lee entrusted him to me.

548
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:23,457
So I'll be the one
watching over
and guiding him.

549
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:27,461
Oh. Like you guided him
into this trap?
[mock laughs]

550
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,597
Okay, look,
I'm taking the kid
to the temple.

551
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:31,332
Good idea.

552
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,335
You can probably
find him a master there
with fewer trust issues.

553
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:36,537
You know what?
Nobody asked you.

554
00:29:36,604 --> 00:29:38,306
Asked me what? To save you?

555
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,975
You're welcome,
by the way.
[blows raspberry]

556
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,777
Dragon just can't
help herself, can she?

557
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:45,746
[chuckles]
Oh, same old Hu.

558
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:49,784
What's the saying
about the tiger and his stripes?
[cackles]

559
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,352
You're hysterical.

560
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,453
I know.

561
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:58,059
Hmm?
Cynthia!

562
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,228
We are closed.
What?

563
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:04,398
Ooh.
Tell me more about how
you have all this handled.

564
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:06,634
Cynthia, it's me, Tiger.

565
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:08,069
It's Hu.

566
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,037
Open the door.
[chuckles]

567
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:11,706
You're embarrassing me
out here.

568
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:12,773
Closed!

569
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,175
This is Zodiac business.

570
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,011
And this is
dim sum business.

571
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:20,681
And we open in three hours.

572
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:21,782
Nicely done.

573
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:22,984
Does anybody like you?

574
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,719
I know how to deal with this.
Mmm.

575
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:29,290
In exchange for entry,
I offer you this 65-year-old
wild ginseng.

576
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:32,360
Hey, Rat,
no more stealing soy sauce.

577
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:35,596
Are you sure
you're not confusing me
with another talking rat?

578
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,265
[Mistral]
Will a hundred bucks do?
Oh!

579
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:39,033
We just opened! Come in.

580
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,035
[grunts] Not a word.
You're welcome.

581
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,837
[chuckles]

582
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:45,773
Oh, that smells so good.
Could we, like, stop
and get a char siu bao?

583
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,041
Nope.
[Mistral] Forgive Hu.

584
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:48,409
He doesn't
understand humans.

585
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,478
Or feelings.
Or the modern world.

586
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:53,981
Or much of anything,
to tell you the truth.
[chuckles]

587
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:58,052
Boy reeks like armpits
and new magic. Who is he?

588
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,521
He's under my protection.
Our protection.

589
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,423
Zodiacs.

590
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,425
Hmm, so what's
going on here?

591
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:07,161
The Temple of the Twelve
is inside a freezer? Really?

592
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:15,369
[chanting in Mandarin]

593
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:19,073
[chanting continues]

594
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,748
[mumbles]

595
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:29,250
It's been a minute.

596
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,004
Hey, thanks for the bun.

597
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,606
You needed it. Too skinny!

598
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,511
Oh. She's a frog.

599
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,716
Whoa.

600
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:06,053
[Sidney] Welcome to
the Temple of the Twelve.

601
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,790
Ooh. So this is like
your magical fortress?

602
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:12,126
You ain't
seen nothing yet.

603
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:16,964
[buzzer blaring]
[sighs]

604
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:21,302
And now, introducing
our starting lineup.

605
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,204
What are we,
a basketball team?

606
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,005
Let Rat do his thing.

607
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,907
Presenting the amazing,

608
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:32,012
the astonishing Zodiac Warriors!

609
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,752
First up,
here is your wake-up call
from Mr. Early Bird himself...

610
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:39,086
[crows]

611
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:40,621
[Sidney] ...Rooster!

612
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,523
Feathers of fury!

613
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,391
Whoa.

614
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:45,493
Pawing his way into your heart,

615
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,696
you gotta love him,
stinky breath and all,

616
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,764
Dog!

617
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,632
Slobber tsunami!

618
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:55,336
[Sidney] Next is the big guy,
all muscle and tussle,

619
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:58,072
the unstoppable Ox!
[bellows]

620
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:02,343
Put your opposable thumbs up
for the simian sorceress
herself: Monkey!

621
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,645
The lean, mean
shrinking machine!

622
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:05,946
[chuckles]
[whoops]

623
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:10,818
She puts the pork in chop
and the belly in flop! Pig!

624
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:12,753
The ham slam!

625
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,258
Bringing the heat,
she's the maniac of pyro.

626
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,693
Give it up for...
Too hot to handle.

627
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,128
[Sidney] ...Dragon!

628
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:25,366
That's not bad, actually.
Don't encourage this.

629
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,168
[Sidney]
If you said it, she's heard it.

630
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:29,970
The adorable Rabbit!

631
00:33:30,037 --> 00:33:31,806
Cute attack!

632
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:34,575
[Sidney]
She's flexible, she's fanged,

633
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:37,912
and you definitely
don't want to find her
in your sleeping bag!

634
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:38,846
Snake!

635
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:41,248
Let's snuggle.

636
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:45,319
The thoroughbred
of speed: Horse!

637
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,721
Maximum horsepower!

638
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,291
[Sidney]
Our explosives expert,

639
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:53,461
the "baaa" of boom...

640
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:55,729
[bleats]

641
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:56,997
[Sidney] Goat!
Whoa.

642
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:58,365
And he's serious,

643
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:01,101
he's complicated,
he's selfish...

644
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:02,703
[chuckles]
[sighs]

645
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,572

Oh.

Thank you for saving me.

Where'd you stash the Phoenix?

00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:28,361
Someplace lucky.

830

I-I hope.

831
00:44:36,002 --> 00:44:37,938
In a bowl of fortune cookies?

832
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:39,406
Super smart, right?

833
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:43,743

I thought it was funny.

838
00:45:02,295 --> 00:45:05,098
[Tom] I've seen place mats
like these all my life.

839
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:07,534
And the whole time,
they were based on you guys.

840
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:09,269
Loosely based.

841
00:45:09,336 --> 00:45:10,403
Look at this.

842
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,908
What is this, a sausage?
With legs? [scoffs]

843
00:45:14,975 --> 00:45:17,344
I do not have facial hair.

844
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,014
I do. And I look good.
[chuckling]

845
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:24,818
[sighs] I miss Pig.

846
00:45:24,885 --> 00:45:26,386
[Sidney] I miss them all.

847
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:27,921
They're our family.

848
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:29,856
We gotta save them.

849
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:34,261
Whatever I need to know
to be a Guardian,
you have to teach me.

850
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:35,395
Please.

851
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:38,198
The Guardian always trains
the next Guardian.

Look, the kid's right.

854
00:45:41,368 --> 00:45:45,338
Without Mrs. Lee,
we don't have much choice,
do we?

855
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:51,811
Your job is to connect
with the Phoenix.

856
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:53,180
Mistral?

857
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:56,983
Whoa.

858
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,619
Clear your mind
of all distraction.

859
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:02,956
In order to see the Phoenix,
you must focus, Tom.

860
00:46:04,424 --> 00:46:08,128
The power of the Phoenix
is the greatest
in this universe.

861
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:10,330
In the right hands,
it creates.

862
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:14,167
And in the wrong hands,
like Loo's, it destroys.

863
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:16,403
So what happens
if she gets it?

864
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,438
She'll unleash its power
on Lunar New Year,

865
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:21,608
when the chi is
at its most potent.

866
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:24,411
Then use the Phoenix
to destroy all of humanity

867
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,581
and reign over the world
in darkness for all of eternity.

868
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:29,516
Okay, that does sound bad.

869
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,586
[Hu] If it were ever unleashed,
no one could touch it
and survive,

870
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:34,287
not even a Guardian.

871
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:37,490
But it's okay to wear it
around my neck, though.
Got it.

00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:39,593
[Cynthia] Steamed dumplings.
Very delicious.

873
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:40,660
I'm not hungry.

874
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:43,129
Eat it!
I mean, mmm.

875
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:45,398
Tom, pass me the soy sauce.

876
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:46,733
Without your hands.

877
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,568
How?
Chi lines.

878
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:52,205
You know, it's like strings
of magical energy
that are everywhere.

879
00:46:52,272 --> 00:46:53,873
You just grab on to one.

880
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,175
Like this.

881
00:46:56,243 --> 00:46:57,544
Oh.

882
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:01,481
[chuckling] Yo!

883
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:03,250
[chuckling]

884
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:04,918
Can you see the Phoenix?

885
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:06,052
No.

886
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,189
I'm easily scared of everything,

887
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:11,658
so protection spells
come in handy. [yelps]

888
00:47:11,725 --> 00:47:14,194

889
00:47:15,595 --> 00:47:17,364

weren't just

00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:22,942
Why didn't you tell me?

971
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:26,813
How am I supposed to
do this without you?

972
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,548
[floor creaking]
[gasps]

973
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,686
No. No, that's impossible.

974
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,689
Are-- Are you--

975
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:39,325
Is it really you?

976
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:42,462
Did you think they could
get rid of me that easily?

977
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:44,597
Ah Ma.

978
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,836
What happened?
Where did you go?

979
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:52,772
A bedtime story for later.

980
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:55,909
Now tell me,
do you still have my necklace?

981
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:57,510
[chuckles]

982
00:51:57,577 --> 00:51:59,579
You never should have
given it to me.

983
00:51:59,646 --> 00:52:03,483
I am no Guardian.
I can't even see the Phoenix.

984
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,320
It's okay, Tom.
Everything's going to be okay.

985
00:52:07,387 --> 00:52:08,555
I'll take it now.

986
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:09,956
[Rav] It's not her!

987
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:12,425
[Tom] No!

988
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:13,993
[gasps]
[Tom] Leave her alone!

989
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:19,198
Oh, look at you.
Somebody's been learning.

990
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:22,302
And you. So ungrateful.

991
00:52:22,368 --> 00:52:24,470
You disappoint your Mama Loo.

992
00:52:24,537 --> 00:52:27,307
Yeah?
You were a terrible mom!

993
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,108
[screams]

994
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:30,843
And your cooking sucked!
Let's go!

995
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,378
Go, go, go!
Okay!

Thank you, Thomas.

1000
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,506
I can't believe
he did this again.

1001
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:02,542
Why does he keep
running away from me?

1002
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:07,447
Oh, does he? Or do you keep
pushing him away? Hmm?

1003
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:09,215
That's not true at all.
Oh, really?

1004
00:53:09,282 --> 00:53:10,984
I've had about enough of--
Ha!

1005
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,385
Typical cat behavior.

1006
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:13,820
What? I don't--

1007
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:15,955
Fiercely independent?
Territorial?

1008
00:53:16,022 --> 00:53:18,491
Should I even mention
the excessive grooming?

1009
00:53:18,558 --> 00:53:21,761
Hey.
A cat won't come to you
when you call them.

1010
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:25,565
They want everything
on their own terms,
when it suits them,

1011
00:53:25,632 --> 00:53:28,201
even with the people
they truly care about.

1012
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:29,902
Am I wrong?

1013
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,205
No.

1014
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:35,208
I pushed them all away.

1015
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:39,812
Tom, the Zodiac,
you probably the most.

1016
00:53:41,547 --> 00:53:43,850
But you wouldn't
leave me, Dragon.

1017
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,385
Why is that?

1018
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:49,389
[sighs]
I guess I'm just a cat person.

1019
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:52,925
[door opening]

1020
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:58,231
Tom!

1021
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,966
I lost it.

1022
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,069
Loo has the Phoenix.

1023
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:04,604
[gasps]

[sighs]

1026
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:46,746
I thought
maybe if I went back
to our house,

1027
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:49,982
I could understand
why she didn't tell me,

1028
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:51,684
and I just found this.

1029
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:58,925
Wow. I gave that to you
when you were just a baby.

1030
00:54:59,892 --> 00:55:01,094
You did?

1031
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,464
I've been watching over you
your whole life.

1032
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,933
Ever since that night
on the bridge.

1033
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,602
We knew
Loo would be back.

1034
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:14,507
So your grandma and I
decided to hide you,
to protect the bloodline.

1035
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:15,775
And it worked--

1036
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:18,778
Until I threw that kid
into the ceiling?

1037
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:22,215
And pulled down
the protective charms.
But you didn't know.

1038
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:24,851
I let Loo take the Phoenix.

1039
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:28,421
That's on me.
[clicks tongue]

1040
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:30,890
I'm sorry I wasn't
the best mentor.

1041
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:35,595
But what I'm finally realizing
after a thousand years

1042
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:38,631
is what matters most,

1043
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:41,567
and that's how
you move forward.

1044
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:45,304
I don't know if I can be
who you need me to be.

1045
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:46,906
You already are.

1046
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,008
It's in your blood.

1047
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:52,411
You come
from a thousand generations
of Guardians, Tom.

1048
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:55,348
Your grandma
gave you the necklace.

1049
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:56,983
She believed in you.

1050
00:55:58,518 --> 00:55:59,886
All right.

1051
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:02,121
How do we find Loo?

1052
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:03,456
We find the Phoenix.

1053
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:05,091
[crowd chattering]

1054
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:07,994

when the energy is at its peak.

[cheering]

1056

reach out and find that Phoenix.

It's too much.

1058
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:34,520
Tom, focus.

1059
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:36,556
I can't. I'm losing it.

1060
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:41,227
Just breathe.
Find something to hold on to,
something to anchor yourself.

1061
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:43,729
It's okay. You're okay.

1062
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:55,041
Loo!

1063
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:57,677
Thomas, just like
your grandmother.

1064
00:56:57,743 --> 00:57:00,112

is a dumpling!

00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:52,465

Huh?

1074
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:54,133

I didn't kill you

Okay, quick!

My apprentice,
he sacrificed himself
to save the mortals.

[Nu Kua]
The boy is beyond healing.

[Hu] But not beyond saving.

1191

Look down, Tiger.
Tell me, what do you see?

1192
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:54,633
Water. An ocean.

1193

[Nu Kua] The Sea of Tears,
where all souls go at the end.

What do you know?

1209

I guess a tiger
can change his stripes!

Great.
Now I'm gonna be hearing
that one forever.

So you couldn't
let me die, huh?

Yeah, let's not make

I have no idea
how it got there.

1232

I-I-I made you a key
to my shop.

1233

That's your sacred gift?

1234
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:15,167
I figured you've got
more training to do and you're
gonna need somewhere to stay,

1235
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:20,038
so maybe it would make sense
if you, I don't know,
consider it your--

1236
01:11:20,105 --> 01:11:21,740
Home?

1237
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:26,511
Yeah. I mean, if you want.

1238
01:11:27,946 --> 01:11:30,982
Well, I do have
a piece of your soul in me,

kind of makes us family.

I get that you're,
